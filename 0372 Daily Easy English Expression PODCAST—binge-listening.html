Do you have a favorite TV show do you have a favorite sports team? So if you watch like the whole season of your favorite TV show or the whole season of your favorite sports team if you watch them you are binge-watching you are binging. If you decide at 11 p.m. that you are hungry and you go to the refrigerator and you see a chocolate cake and you eat all of the chocolate cake you are binge-eating, now that's not necessarily very good. Binge-shopping can also be dangerous if you are binging you are  doing an extreme amount of listening or watching or eating or drinking something can be very dangerous, but binge-listening that's very healthy, check out the dialogue.
