	There we go. Is your mother a good cook? Are you married? Is your wife a good cook? Who is the better cook your wife or your mother? Be honest. Yeah I think most guys, I'm sorry ladies, I think most guys would say their mother. Yeah I'm guessing I'm guessing I don't know I'm just guessing that most guys would say their mother is better, so I think, sorry guys, I think most guys would say: my wife's chicken is good, but it pales in comparison to my moms. And ladies let me ask you, are you married? Who is cooler, who's more of a man your dad or your husband who's more of a man? I don't know but I'm guessing that most ladies would say that their dad is more of a man than their husband. I don't know I'm just guessing so ladies you could say: Yeah my husband he, he is good but he pales in comparison to my dad. I don't know, now see you  now right now coach Shane is bad guy is causing problems throughout the world between husbands and wives so let's find a different subject to compare A and B. Do you have a favorite English teacher, a favorite English teacher who is not coach Shane then you could say this: Yep coach Shane is good but he pales in comparison to ... and then you have to save your English teacher. And if you do this I'm going to cry don't make me cry yeah, you guys can lie, you guys can say  somebody else is good but he pales in comparison to coach Shane or she pales in comparison to coach Shane. I don't want to hear I want to hear that. No I'm teasing. You could be honest or actually instead of being honest just don't tell me. So nobody leaves a comment I'm going to cry. I'm not much of a man I'm not much of a cook. That's today expression. A pales in comparison to B. Pales p-a-l-e-s in comparison c-o-m-p-a-r-i-s-o-n pales in comparison to. A pales in comparison to B. It's a great expression the same thing A is not as good as B but once again pales in comparison is upgrade, so do that to your English.
