<p>
	Hello everybody my name is coach Shane and welcome to easy English expressions. You and me everyday, come on  let's master English! Hello everybody welcome back to daily easy English expression the podcast. Today we have a very nice expression it's very easy and very useful it is: sit tight, sit tight. If somebody says sit tight to you they are saying sit s-i-t t-i-g-h-t sit tight and it means wait, please wait, don't do anything just wait, all you need to do is wait. Okay? So if you are applying for something and you sending your application and you're waiting for news or waiting for information so you call: Ah, yes this is Shane Peterson? I sent in my application. Oh yes we have it here just sit tight, we will call you when we look at it, just it just stay there, don't do anything, don't worry, we have it, we would do something and then we will call you we will let you know, we will come to you - that's the idea. It's a great expression. So you guys might sometimes be waiting for this podcast and you might say: "where is it? Why is it late today?" Just sit tight, sit tight coach Shane is making it, coach Shane will uploaded, maybe he's sick, maybe he's busy, maybe he fell asleep, that's the idea. Just sit tight it's going to be taken care of. Let's check out the dialogue.

	 This is a very good expression and you might have the chance to hear it. Let's say you want to travel to the United States you need to get a visa. So you go to the embassy and you get a number and the person might say just sit tight we will call your number and then you go for the interview and then they say alright everything's taken care of just sit tight and we will send you your visa. I don't know how they do it but that's the idea it's a very nice expression. Now, if you're a teacher you'll definitely be able to use it. Your students might ask you: when do we get our grades? just sit tight; when do you return the test? just sit tight; when will you bla-bla-bla ... just sit tight. If you are boss you can use it to your employees. However if you work at a company I don't really recommend that you use this too much with your customers, because it kind of has the idea that your customers are very anxious, maybe there are impatient and you don't want to ever give your customers that feeling. So sit tight is somebody you use if you have authority if the people are (sort of) speak below you like students or employees or once again if you're the government and your giving a driver's license or a visa to somebody, then you have the power, you have the power. So that's the idea. It's a great expression. Now personally I don't think I've used this expression too much even though I'm a teacher, but I have heard it a lot definitely. I heard it not too long ago, when I was ... what was I'm doing? Oh, I was paying for my utility bill I'm said okay, I might like to pay for my utility bill and the guy said just sit tight I'll call you when it's your turn. Yep so I sit down and I waited for him to call my name. So it is a great expression once again it's an expression that you're probably here more than use, sit tight -sit down,try to relax, don't do anything, just wait that's the idea. Let's check out the dialogue two more times and together let's master English!
